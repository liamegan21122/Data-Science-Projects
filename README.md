# Data-Science-Projects

Hello and welcome to my data science project repository. This repository contains three projects and a cumulative final project that demonstrates my knowledge of the general data science pipeline. These projects were obtained from a course titled CMSC 320 - Introduction to Data Science, that I took at the University of Maryland, College Park. The course covered a wide range of topics related to the data science field, but the main topics were: data curation, parsing, and management; exploratory data analysis; hypothesis testing and machine learning to provide analysis. The three individual projects roughly cover the aforementioned topics, but my final project which examines student alcohol consumption and academic performance covers all of them. All projects were written solely by myself.

PLEASE NOTE:

There is an error in opening my final project directly through github, so in order to view it please go here:
